### Project Solution:
Identifying weld defects is a critical objective in the field of non-destructive testing (NDT) of welds. In this work, we compare the performance of a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with that of a CNN enhanced by quantum methods, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of quantum techniques in improving weld defect identification.

A key aspect of this comparison is the use of Explainable AI (XAI), which plays a crucial role in understanding and interpreting the models' decision-making processes. By employing Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) as an XAI tool, we provide visual explanations that reveal how each model identifies defects. The Grad-CAM results clearly demonstrate the superiority of quantum methods over classical approaches, offering deeper insights into why these advanced techniques lead to more accurate and reliable weld defect detection.

This explainability is essential for validating and trusting the results, especially when comparing the capabilities of AI and quantum techniques in critical applications like NDT.
Grad-CAM helped me to make a better comparison and understand the effectiveness and necessity of quantum based AI methods on real world cases.
